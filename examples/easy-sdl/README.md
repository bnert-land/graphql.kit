##  Prebuilt Service Example

This example provides an easy interface which can be used for a new GraphQL application.

What is shown in `server.core` is representative of what most new GraphQL
applications may need. 

To run the server:
```shell
# In Shell 0
$ clj -M -m server.core
```

To open GraphiQL, open your preferred browser and navigate to
`http://localhost:9113/graphiql`, or via shell:
```shell
$ open http://localhost:9113/graphiql
```
